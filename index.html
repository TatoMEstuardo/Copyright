<center>CopyRight Is Good!!!!</center>

<p>I think Copyright is a good thing because if there was no copyright then can steal stuff. For example if you a song and you upload it to youtube and someone copies it and upload it again and his video gets more views than you, then he claims that it is his that you just lost all your work. Thats why i think it is good because people cant steal your stuff/creations</p>
